# Validator Manual

This manual describes the process of spinning up an SGN node and joining the network as a validator.

**NOTE: The manual assumes familiarity with Unix command line and blockchain validator nodes.
Prior experience with Cosmos SDK and Ethereum transactions will be helpful.**

## Prepare machine and install dependencies

We run on Ubuntu Linux amd64 with Amazon EC2 as an example. Feel free to experiment with other VPS or physical server setups on your own.

1. Start an EC2 machine with the Ubuntu 20.04 LTS image. We recommend using `c5a.xlarge` (4 vCPUs, 8GB RAM and 10Gbps network bandwidth) with an EBS volume of at least
100GB for testnet and `c5a.2xlarge` (8 vCPUs, 16GB RAM and 10Gbps network bandwidth) with an EBS volume of at least 500GB for mainnet. Use the appropriate security
groups and a keypair that you have access to.

2. Install go (at least 1.16):

    ```sh
    sudo snap install go --classic
    ```

    Install gcc and make :

    ```sh
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install gcc make
    ```

    (Optional) If you are on Ubuntu and choose to use cleveldb, which is reported to be more performant, install libleveldb-dev:

    ```sh
    sudo apt install libleveldb-dev
    ```

3. Set \$GOBIN and add \$GOBIN to \$PATH. Edit `$HOME/.profile` and add:

    ```sh
    export GOBIN=$HOME/go/bin; export GOPATH=$HOME/go; export PATH=$PATH:$GOBIN
    ```

    to the end, then:

    ```sh
    source $HOME/.profile
    ```

4. (Optional) Install geth:

    ```sh
    sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ethereum/ethereum
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install ethereum
    ```

## Setup binary, config and accounts

1. From the `/home/ubuntu` directory, download and install the `sgnd` binary:

    ```sh
    curl -L https://github.com/celer-network/sgn-v2-networks/releases/download/v1.6.2/sgnd-v1.6.2-goleveldb-linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar -xz
    # To use with cleveldb on Ubuntu, download https://github.com/celer-network/sgn-v2-networks/releases/download/v1.6.2/sgnd-v1.6.2-cleveldb-ubuntu-linux-amd64.tar.gz
    mv sgnd $GOBIN
    ```

2. From the `/home/ubuntu` directory, clone the `sgn-v2-networks` repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/celer-network/sgn-v2-networks
    # sgn-partnernet-1000 for testnet and sgn-3 for mainnet
    cd sgn-v2-networks/<network-name>
    ```

3. Copy the config files:

    ```sh
    mkdir -p $HOME/.sgnd/config
    cp * $HOME/.sgnd/config
    ```

4. Initialize the new validator node:

    `node-name` is a name you specify for the node.

    ```sh
    sgnd init <node-name> --chain-id <network-name> --home $HOME/.sgnd
    # Overwrite genesis.json and config.toml with the ones from sgn-v2-networks
    cp genesis.json config.toml $HOME/.sgnd/config
    # Create an empty Tendermint snapshots directory
    mkdir -p $HOME/.sgnd/data/snapshots
    ```

    Backup the generated Tendermint key files `$HOME/.sgnd/config/node_key.json` and `$HOME/.sgnd/config/priv_validator_key.json` securely. Make sure the keys are **never** committed to any repo.

5. Fill out the fields in the Tendermint config file `$HOME/.sgnd/config/config.toml` with the correct values:

    | Field | Description |
    | ----- | ----------- |
    | moniker | The `node-name` you decided |
    | external_address| `<public-ip:26656>`, where `public-ip` is the public IP of the machine hosting the node |
    | db_backend | `goleveldb` or `cleveldb` depending on the binary used |

    Currently, the Celer foundation nodes restrict the access to port 26656-26657, so please **report your public IP to the Celer team** to get whitelisted.

6. Add a Cosmos SDK / Tendermint validator account:

    ```sh
    sgnd keys add <node-name>
    ```

    Input a passphrase for the keyring. Backup the passphrase along with the displayed mnemonic phrase securely. Make sure they are **never** committed to any repo.

    To view the account created, run:

    ```sh
    sgnd keys list
    ```

    Make a note of the **sgn-prefixed account address**.

7. Prepare an Ethereum gateway URL. You can use services like [Infura](https://infura.io/),
[Alchemy](https://alchemyapi.io/) or run your own node.

8. Prepare an Ethereum key as the **validator key**, which will be used for initializing the validator and occasional operations such as withdrawing rewards. Therefore, the validator key does not need to stay online.

    The validator key can be prepared via one of the two ways:

    - **Using a local keystore JSON file** (easier setup)

      Currently, the advantage of a local keystore JSON is that operations can be done via the command line. However, it will require saving a passphrase in clear text on the machine running the node, so please be careful about access control.

      Assuming `geth` is installed, the keystore JSON file can be generated via:

      ```sh
      geth account new
      ```

      Backup the passphrase securely. Save the JSON file as `$HOME/.sgnd/eth-ks/val.json`:

      ```sh
      mkdir $HOME/.sgnd/eth-ks
      cp <path-to-keystore-json> $HOME/.sgnd/eth-ks/val.json
      ```

    - **Using MetaMask / hardware wallet** (better security)

      This approach is more secure than a local keystore, but it will require interacting with the staking contract via Etherscan.

      Please reserve a dedicated account on MetaMask. If using a hardware wallet, make sure it is compatible with MetaMask.

9. Prepare another Ethereum key as the **signer key**, which will be used for signing cross-chain transactions and needs to stay online.

    The signer key can be prepared via one of the two ways:

    - **Using a local keystore JSON file** (easier setup)

      Follow the same steps as preparing the validator key. Save the JSON file as `$HOME/.sgnd/eth-ks/signer.json`.

    - **Using AWS Key Management Service (KMS)** (better security)

      For better security, we support using AWS KMS to manage the signer key.
      Follow [this doc](aws_kms.md) to set it up.

10. Fill out the fields in the SGN-specific config file `$HOME/.sgnd/config/sgn.toml` with the correct values:

    | Field | Description |
    | ----- | ----------- |
    | eth.gateway | The Ethereum gateway URL obtained from step 7 |
    | eth.signer_keystore | The path to the signer Ethereum keystore file in step 9, or the format required by AWS KMS setup |
    | eth.signer_passphrase | The passphrase of the signer keystore, or the format required by AWS KMS setup |
    | eth.validator_address | The **Ethereum address** of the validator key prepared in step 8 |
    | sgnd.passphrase | The **Cosmos keyring passphrase** you typed in step 6 |
    | sgnd.validator_account | The **sgn-prefixed validator Cosmos SDK account** added in step 6 |

11. Fill in the missing gateway URLs in `$HOME/.sgnd/config/cbridge.toml` with the corresponding JSON-RPC URLs for the chains. In general, we recommend using paid provider services instead of the public endpoints for better reliability.

## Run validator with systemd

We recommend using systemd to run your validator. Feel free to experiment with other setups on your own.

1. Prepare the sgnd system service:

    ```sh
    sudo mkdir -p /var/log/sgnd
    sudo touch /var/log/sgnd/tendermint.log
    sudo touch /var/log/sgnd/app.log
    sudo touch /etc/systemd/system/sgnd.service
    ```

    Add the following to `/etc/systemd/system/sgnd.service`:

    ```
    [Unit]
    Description=SGN daemon
    After=network-online.target

    [Service]
    Environment=HOME=/home/ubuntu
    ExecStart=/home/ubuntu/go/bin/sgnd start \
      --home /home/ubuntu/.sgnd/
    StandardOutput=append:/var/log/sgnd/tendermint.log
    StandardError=append:/var/log/sgnd/app.log
    Restart=always
    RestartSec=3
    User=ubuntu
    Group=ubuntu
    LimitNOFILE=4096

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

    With this setup, `tendermint.log` contains Tendermint logs (i.e. block height, peer info, etc.) while `app.log`
    contains SGN-specific logs.

2. Create `/etc/logrotate.d/sgn` and add the following:

    ```
    /var/log/sgnd/*.log {
        compress
        copytruncate
        daily
        maxsize 30M
        rotate 30
    }
    ```

3. Add an entry to `/etc/crontab` to make logrotate run every 6 hours:

    ```
    30 */6  * * *   root    logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.conf
    ```

4. Currently, we require using Tendermint state sync to sync your node. Follow the instructions in [this doc](state_sync.md) to prepare the node
receiving the snapshot with `up-to-date-node-ip`s taken from the `seeds` field in `$HOME/.sgnd/config/config.toml`.
Stop short of starting the node.

5. Enable and start the sgnd service:

    ```sh
    sudo systemctl enable sgnd.service
    sudo systemctl start sgnd.service
    ```

    Now the node should start the state sync. Monitor `tendermint.log` for the progress:

    ```sh
    tail -f /var/log/sgnd/tendermint.log
    ```

    You can tell the node is synced when a new block shows up about every 5 seconds.

6. (Currently unsupported) If you choose not to setup state sync, the node will perform a traditional "fast sync" instead.
In this mode it replays and verifies all historical transactions starting from genesis.

## Claim validator status

1. Contact the Celer team to get whitelisted for a validator spot.

2. Run `sgnd ops view params` to check the staking contract parameters. Take notes of the following two values:
    - `Min validator tokens`: the minimum delegated tokens to become a bonded valdiator.
    - `Min self delegations`: the minimum self-delegated tokens become a bonded valdiator.

3. Send enough CELR for the intended self delegation to your **validator address**, and some ETH for gas to both the **validator and signer addresses**.

    For testnet, obtain some Goerli ETH from places like the Paradigm [faucet](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/). Contact the Celer team for some Goerli test CELR tokens.

4. Initialize the validator by calling [initializeValidator](https://github.com/celer-network/sgn-v2-contracts/blob/main/contracts/Staking.sol#L94-L104) on the staking contract and [updateSgnAddr](https://github.com/celer-network/sgn-v2-contracts/blob/main/contracts/SGN.sol#L42) on the sgn contract. 

    Example below sets a `_commissionRate` of 6% and `_minSelfDelegation` (must be equal or greater than the `min self delegations` value obtained at step 2) of 10000 CELR.

    - **For validator key on local keystore JSON file**: use command line

      ```sh
      sgnd ops validator init --commission-rate 0.06 --min-self-delegation 10000 --keystore ~/.sgnd/eth-ks/val.json --passphrase <val-ks-passphrase>
      ```

    - **For validator key on MetaMask / hardware wallet**: interact through etherscan.

      First, approve CELR tokens to the `Staking` contract:

      - Go to [Etherscan](etherscan.io) for either Goerli or mainnet, search for the **celr** contract address taken from `eth.contract_addresses` in `$HOME/.sgnd/sgn.toml`. You should see the verified `CelerToken` contract on the corresponding network.

      - Make sure the validator address is selected on your MetaMask / hardware wallet. Click on the "Write Contract" button under the "Contract" tab, click on "Connect to Web3" to connect your wallet.

      - Find the `approve` method.

        For `spender`, put the **staking** contract address taken from `eth.contract_addresses` in `$HOME/.sgnd/sgn.toml`.

        For `amount`, put at least the amount of CELR tokens intended for self delegation times the decimals of CELR, which is 1e18. Eg. `10000000000000000000000` for 10000 CELR. Feel free to approve more.

        Click "Write" and send the transaction.

      Then, initialize the validator with a self delegation:

      - Find the `Staking` contract on Etherscan and connect the validator address to "Write Contract".

      - Find the `initializeValidator` method.

        For `signer`, put the address of the **signer key**.

        For `minSelfDelegation`, put the amount of CELR tokens for self delegation times 1e18.

        For `commissionRate`, put the intended commission rate times 10000. Eg. 600 would represent 6%.

        Click "Write" and send the transaction.

      Finally, register the sgn-prefixed validator account address on the SGN contract:

      - Find the `SGN` contract on Etherscan using the **sgn** address taken from `eth.contract_addresses` in `$HOME/.sgnd/sgn.toml` and connect the validator address to "Write Contract".

      - Find the `updateSgnAddr` method.

        Run the command `sgnd ops validator address`, paste the output value after **sgn acct address in hex** into the `sgnAddr` field on Etherscan.

        Click "Write" and send the transaction.

    Note that it will take some time for the existing SGN validators to sync your new validator. Afterwards, verify your validator status:

    ```sh
    sgnd query staking validator <val-eth-address>
    ```

5. Update validator description:

    ```sh
    echo $COSMOS_KEYRING_PASSPHRASE | sgnd tx staking edit-description --website "your-website" --contact "email-address"
    ```

    Note that `COSMOS_KEYRING_PASSPHRASE` here is the passphrase for the keyring used in `sgnd keys add`.

    After a while, verify the updated description:

    ```sh
    sgnd query staking validator <val-eth-address>
    ```

6. Delegate more tokens if your `_minSelfDelegation` is smaller than `min validator tokens` value obtained at step 2. The additional delegation can come from any key.

    - **Using CLI with local keystore JSON file**

      ```sh
      sgnd ops delegator delegate --validator <val-eth-address> --amount <amount> --keystore <path-to-keystore-file> --passphrase <ks-passphrase>
      ```

    - **Using staking web with MetaMask / hardware wallet**

      Connect your wallet to the SGN staking website ([testnet](https://sgn-partner-testnet.celer.network/#/staking), [mainnet]()), choose your validator node, and then follow the process after click the `Delegate` button.

7. Verify validator status. Run following command a few minutes after your validator has enough delegations. 

    ```sh
    sgnd query staking validator <val-eth-address>
    ```

    If you have delegated enough tokens to qualify as a bonded validator, you should see that your validator has the status of `BOND_STATUS_BONDED`.

    You can verify that your validator is in the Tendermint validator set:

    ```sh
    sgnd query tendermint-validator-set
    ```

    You should see an entry with `address` matching the `sgn consensus address` printed as the output of `sgnd ops validator address`.

    You can also verify the delegation:

    ```sh
    sgnd query staking delegation <val-eth-address> <val-eth-address>
    ```

    NOTE: The Staking contract implements a basic decentralization check. If you somehow delegated too many CELR tokens so that your validator has more than 1/3 of the total stakes, you will not be able to bond the validator. Contact the Celer team to resolve the situation and refer to next step to bond the validator manually.

8. (Optional) If something went wrong and your validator is not bonded automatically, you can do so manually through the following command

    ```sh
    sgnd ops validator bond
    ```

    After a while, verify the status:

    ```sh
    sgnd query staking validator <val-eth-address>
    ```

    You should see that your validator has the status of `BOND_STATUS_BONDED`.
